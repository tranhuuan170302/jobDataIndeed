We’re not alone either. WebCargo is a proud part of the Freightos Group, a logistics technology company that aims to make global trade frictionless. That’s not cheap, so we’ve raised nearly $100 million from investors like GE Ventures, the Singapore Exchange and Aleph, making and have gotten the BBC, TechCrunch, and the Wall Street Journal excited about freight.

Turns out it’s kind of a big deal. As one of the largest tech platforms for a huge industry (the phone or computer you’re reading this on was, after all shipped), we’ve been crushing it with double-digit growth, year after year.

You have to talk the talk. This means you need to be a fluent English speaker and a fluent Vietnamese speaker.
You should have at least 5 years of experience in giving customer-facing support, training, or localization/translation/interpretation in technology or logistics sectors.
Effective training and communication skills to be able to help new users understand the platform, and help them adopt a new way of booking freight.

Effective communication skills and ability to interact at different levels of Webcargo’s partner organizations.
Preferred Requirements

Enclosure 1
Sources Sought Notification
1. Description
The USAID Improving Private Sector Competitiveness (hereafter referred to as “IPSC”) is a U.S.Agency for International Development (USAID) technical assistance project, and the Agency for Enterprise Development (AED) under the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) is the Project owner, is seeking information on how interested contractors can support anticipated technical program needs. The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to gather information about potential qualified firms that have the capacity to implement the activities outlined below.
This Sources Sought is issued solely for information and planning purposes – it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Further, IPSC is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that IPSC will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this Sources Sought and all costs associated with responding to this notification will be solely at the interested party’s expense.
Not responding to this Sources Sought Notification will not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. Firms meeting the qualifications outlined below may be invited to pre-register in Deloitte’s system and may be sent future RFP opportunities.
2. Background
IPSC supports Vietnam’s private sector development, consistent with the direction and objectives of the Government of Vietnam (GVN), to improve the capacity and number of private businesses, enhance the policy environment where there are barriers to private sector development, and strengthen Vietnam’s competitiveness. Vietnam has taken significant strides towards sustainable economic growth, however Small and Growing Businesses (SGBs) face numerous challenges in accessing knowledge, capital, and markets. IPSC seeks to remove policy, market, and firm-level constraints inhibiting the growth of SGBs, including those owned or led by women and vulnerable populations. The goal of IPSC is to foster an innovative and dynamic private sector that expands economic opportunities domestically and is competitive regionally and globally.
IPSC is comprised of four interrelated Objectives:
Objective 1. Building business management capacity of SGBs, including those led by vulnerable populations.
Objective 2. Improving efficiency and productivity by promoting innovation, technology adoption, and sustainable business models.
Objective 3. Enhancing the business enabling environment (BEE) for a broad-based inclusive economy.
Objective 4. Strengthening business-to-business (B2B) and cross-sectoral linkages.
3. Objective
One of IPSC’s main objectives of IPSC is supporting 60 Pioneering Enterprises (PEs) to receive customized technical assistance under the overall support package “Vietnamese Value – Reach out to the World” to create products with added value and Vietnamese intellectual property, nurturing them to become sustainable models for other SGBs to emulate and scale up proven examples. A PE is defined as a growing Vietnamese-registered enterprise with domestic-branded products or services; proven competitiveness; the ability to lead and expand in their respective industry, sector, and locality; strong management capacity and willingness to innovate and produce products with high added value; and the vision to build a Vietnamese brand in domestic or international markets. PEs are a subcategory of SGBs though with a higher capacity than traditional smaller scale SGBs. Positioning the “Made by Vietnam” product brand successfully in regional and international markets is a priority for PEs.
IPSC will provide support packages customized for the individual PE, depending on their situation, needs, development capacity, commitment to participate, and willingness to co-invest. The support packages will focus on facilitating Business Development Service Providers (BDSPs) and technical experts to deliver consulting services and specialized training to help enterprises strengthen their governance, management capability, and strategies. IPSC will develop Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each supporting package so PEs can quantify results achieved and evaluate the effectiveness of the results.
With this Sources Sought, IPSC is looking to identify potential BDSPs that can support initiatives with the PEs to provide technical assistance in implementing individualized support packages. IPSC requires firms with practical experience that can deliver consulting services in several technical areas as identified in each PE action plan.
An illustrative description of technical areas for potential support includes, but is not limited, to the following:
Area 1: Financial and Operation Management
Business Administration: Operational Planning, Quality control, Supply Chain Management, and Production Management
